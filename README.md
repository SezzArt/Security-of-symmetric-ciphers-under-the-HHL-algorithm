# Security-of-symmetric-ciphers-under-the-HHL-algorithm
The source code used to verify whether the Hamming weight of i'th derivative of a cipher follows binomial distribution. The results were published in []. Currently supported cipher are Trivium, HC-128 and Salsa20. 

The Salsa20 implementation was taken from https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/cipher/cipher.html

The HC-128 implementation was taken from https://bashtage.github.io/randomgen/index.html

The Trivium implementation was taken from https://pypi.org/project/pytrivium/
